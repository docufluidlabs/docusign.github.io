## How to Use the App

The Procore extension app bridges DocuSign with your project data - automatically syncing signed documents, updating custom fields, and triggering workflows based on document events.

Whether you're managing subcontractor agreements, change orders, or insurance documents, this extension ensures project teams always have access to the latest version and status - without leaving Procore. After installation, Procore options appear in the Workflow Builder.

You can start by creating a new workflow by following [this link](https://apps-d.docusign.com/send/workflows) or pressing Agreements → Maestro Workflows → Create Workflow.

In the workflow, when adding a new step, you'll see three Procore options:

- **File Upload** – Upload the file from Procore to use it later for Workflow.
- **Writeback to Procore** – Update or create new data directly in your Procore workspace.
- **Read from Procore** – Retrieve row data (such as IDs or values) for use in other steps.

## How to Reconnect the App

You can connect a Procore account to DocuSign Maestro. When you connect to Maestro, you can build workflows that read from and write to your Procore data. If you experience problems with your Procore connection, you can reconnect Maestro and Procore.

Use this procedure to reconnect the application:

- Log in to your DocuSign eSignature account with account administrator credentials.

- In a new browser window, go to the appropriate environment for your account ([Production](https://apps.docusign.com/app-center) or [Demo](https://apps-d.docusign.com/app-center)).

- Select the Procore icon and click "Manage Connections".

- Select the three-dot menu icon next to a connection and choose "Reconnect".

The page refreshes.
